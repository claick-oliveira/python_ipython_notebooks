Jupyter - iPython Notebooks
===========================

Hi! I am a Linux user studying statistics and data science.

A few days ago I found Jupyter, the iPython Notebook.

It is a wonderful piece of software, very easy to use and very powerful.

You can write using markdown, Latex and create very nice graphs.

 Install
-------

Just clone the repo and execute the start script. 
The browser window will open showing the Jupyter screen.

```
git clone https://github.com/wesleyit/python_ipython_notebooks.git
cd python_ipython_notebooks
./start.sh
```

To stop using, just execute the stop script.

```
./stop.sh
```

Thanks for using :)
